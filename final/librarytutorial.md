# 3 Library Tutorial

For my final project, I am using the p5.js Sound Library to play the names of the animals in English and Spanish I recorded when a specific animal is clicked on. I will be adding a variable that will allow it to differentiate the language selected and therefore play the respective sound depending on that.
