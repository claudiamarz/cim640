# 3 ideas 

1. Flower Idea
For my first idea, I'd like to use the flower I created earlier in the semester and adding to the code in order to make it more interactive. I'd create buttons that have the functionality of changing the flower's colors, changing the background and playing music. I'd like to switch between two locations, such as a garden and/or a tropical forest, possibly include a watering can as a hitzone, change the color of the flower from pink to yellow and lastly play birds chirping or some kind of background noise.

2. Animal Learning Game 
I'd like to create a game for children to become familiar with animals and the sounds they each make. I'd like to place three to four animals, such as farm animals for example, and place them in a barn. Whenever you click on on a specific animal it will play a noise that animal makes. This way children will learn the names of animals, what they look like and the sounds they make.

3. Language Game
For my third idea, I'd like to create a grid using 16 squares. There will be 8 words in English and 8 words in Spanish or another language. The objective is to match the word in English to its translation in Spanish as fast as you can.


# 3 First Code Plan

My final project is going to be an interactive children's learning game. The game will include 5-6 farm animals or jungle animals and will pronounce the name of the animal in English and Spanish when you click on the button with its name on it. I might add a slider in order to pronounce the name of the animal in a third language.
