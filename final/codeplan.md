# 3 First Code Plan

My final project is going to be an interactive children's learning game. The game will include 5-6 farm animals or jungle animals and will pronounce the name of the animal in English and Spanish when you click on the button with its name on it. I might add a slider in order to pronounce the name of the animal in a third language.   

# 3 Final Code Plan

For my project, I'm going to have a canvas with four farm animals: a pig, rooster, cow and horse. It will have a dropdown menu or slider on the top left corner that will allow users to alternate between English and Spanish. When you click on a specific animal, for example the horse, it will say its name in the language that's selected. Once you switch languages, it will change the language the name recordings are as well.
